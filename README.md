# FishingLog

The application aims to eliminate the need for filling out a paper version of the fishing log for each fishing session and facilitate the collection of data from the sessions.

Each year in Poland, approximately 600,000 anglers fill out such logs.

To process the data, assuming an optimistic scenario that one log takes 5 minutes to complete, it would require 50,000 man-hours to enter this data into an Excel spreadsheet. With around 2,500 fishing clubs in Poland, this translates to 20 man-hours per club.
